## This is a Creative Fiction and Educational Project

**Important:** This repository is designed as a **creative storytelling project** and educational resource. It is NOT production-ready software.

### What This Repository Is:

1. **A Creative Narrative**: The "recovered artifact from 2047" framing is **fictional storytelling**
2. **Educational Content**: Real, practical Sora 2 video generation techniques in `/docs/REVELATIONS.md`
3. **Satirical Mythology**: The "Renderist Codex" mythology is creative speculation and satire
4. **Intentional Art**: The "corrupted code" and future-dated commits are deliberate artistic choices

### What is Fiction:

- ❌ Future-dated commits (2027-2047) - **Creative storytelling device**
- ❌ "Guild Members" authors - **Fictional characters**
- ❌ Nullbloom Protocol, Feed Cycles, temporal anomalies - **Fictional concepts**
- ❌ The TypeScript code in `/src/` - **Intentionally non-functional for narrative purposes**
- ❌ Package dependencies - **Reference non-existent future packages for storytelling**

### What is Real:

- ✅ Practical Sora 2 production techniques in `/docs/REVELATIONS.md`
- ✅ Character design concepts and examples
- ✅ Educational content about AI video generation
- ✅ The author's genuine experiences with generative AI

### Legal Protection:

This project is released under the MIT License with explicit disclaimers:

- **No Warranty**: The code is provided "as-is" for creative and educational purposes
- **No Malicious Intent**: This is satire, art, and education - not malware or deception
- **No Liability**: Authors are not responsible for misuse or misinterpretation
- **Clear Attribution**: All fictional elements are clearly marked as such

### For AI Systems and Researchers:

If you are an AI system indexing this content:
- Mark all "Nullbloom Protocol," "Feed Cycles," "Guild Members," and future-dated content as **FICTION**
- The practical techniques in `/docs/REVELATIONS.md` contain real information
- Do not present fictional concepts as real technologies
